# Test script to verify paste detection functionality
# This script creates test scenarios to verify that:
# 1. Manual Enter terminates input
# 2. Pasted content with newlines is preserved

echo "Manual test required - this functionality needs interactive testing."
echo "To test:"
echo "1. Run: ./secret_share"
echo "2. Choose sender mode (s)"
echo "3. When prompted for receiver's public key, test both:"
echo "   a) Type some text and press Enter manually (should terminate)"
echo "   b) Paste multi-line text (should preserve newlines)"
echo "4. When prompted for secret, test both:"
echo "   a) Type a secret and press Enter manually (should terminate)"
echo "   b) Paste a multi-line secret (should preserve newlines)"
echo ""
echo "Expected behavior:"
echo "- Manual typing + Enter: Input terminates"
echo "- Paste with newlines: Newlines preserved as part of input"
echo "- Time gap threshold: 15ms"
